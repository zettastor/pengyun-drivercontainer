DriverContainer is the network driver container for ZettaStor DBS, used to control the mounting and unmounting operations of [Coordinator](https://github.com/zettastor/pengyun-coordinator)s. When DriverContainer receives a request to mount a volume, it selects a driver from within the container to mount the volume for use by the clients. DriverContainer can only manage the Coordinators on its own node. Typically, one client connection corresponds to one Coordinator, and Coordinators cannot be deployed separately from DriverContainer.
